  <p><strong>Lyrics</strong>
  <br>Turn around, <u><a href title="때로는, 때때로, 가장">every now and then</a></u><br>I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round<br>Turn around, every now and then<br>I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears<br>Turn around, every now and then<br>I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by<br>Turn around, every now and then<br>I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes<br>Turn around, bright eyes<br>Every now and then I <u><a href title="무너져 내리다">fall apart</a></u><br>Turn around, bright eyes<br>Every now and then I fall apart<br>And I need you now tonight<br>And I need you more than ever<br>And if you only hold me tight<br>We'll be holding on forever<br>And we'll only be making it right<br>'Cause we'll never be wrong<br>Together we can take it to <u><a href title="목적지, 한계">the end of the line</a></u><br>Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time<br>I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark<br>We're living in a <u><a href title="일촉즉발의 상황, 위험상태">powder keg</a></u> and <u><a href title="불똥이 튀다"">giving off sparks</a></u><br>I really need you tonight<br>Forever's gonna to start tonight<br>Forever's gonna to start tonight<br>Once upon a time I was falling in love<br>Now I'm only falling apart<br>There's nothing I can do<br>A <u><a href target="_blank" title="개기일식">total eclipse</a></u> of the heart<br>Once upon a time there was light in my life<br>But now there's only love in the dark<br>Nothing I can say<br>A total eclipse of the heart<br>Turn around, bright eyes<br>Every now and then I fall apart<br>Turn around, bright eyes<br>Every now and then I fall apart<br>And I need you now tonight<br>And I need you more than ever<br>And if you only hold me tight<br>We'll be holding on forever<br>And we'll only be making it right<br>Together we can take it to the end of the line<br>Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time<br>I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark<br>We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks<br>I really need you tonight<br>Forever's gonna to start tonight<br>Forever's gonna to start tonight<br>Once upon a time I was falling in love<br>Now I'm only falling apart<br>Nothing I can say<br>A total eclipse of the heart<br>A total eclipse of the heart<br>A total eclipse of the heart<br>Turn around, bright eyes</p>
